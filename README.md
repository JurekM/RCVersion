# RCVersion
This program modifies version in Windows resource source (.RC) file.
The intention is that you can use it in an automated build to set version from build properties.

Run with /? parameter for command line options.

Example command lines:

  RCVersion C:\Projects\RCVersion\RCVersion\RCVersion.rc /b:$(SCCREVISION)
  RCVersion C:\Projects\RCVersion\RCVersion\RCVersion.rc /b:$(SCCREVISION) /m:1 /n:3 /r:0

This program may or may not process invalid RC files.

This program will handle standard RC files as generated by Visual Studio. It will not handle
comments embedded in the middle of the version even if RC.exe would accept that. Such files
are not normally created by Visual Studio. Example:

Accepted by RC.exe and accepted by RCVersion:
 /**/FILEVERSION/**/ 1, 2, 3, 4/**/
 /**/VALUE/**/ "FileVersion"/**/,/**/ "1, 2, 3, 4/**/"

Accepted by RC.exe but not accepted by RCVersion:
 FILEVERSION 1/**/,2, 3, 4
 FILEVERSION 1,/**/2, 3, 4
