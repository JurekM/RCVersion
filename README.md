# RCVersion
This program modifies version in Windows resource source (.RC) file. The intention is that you
can use it in an automated build to set version from build properties. The new version string
is always formatted with four numbers separated by comma-space. The old version string can be
either comma or period separated. RCVersion will accept any combination of spaces, periods and
commas. So input string "1., ., 2,.,.3,,,,0" will be replaced with "1, 2, 4, 0". However string
"1.5a" will not be accepted. Example:
```
VS_VERSION_INFO VERSIONINFO
 FILEVERSION 1,2,3,0
 PRODUCTVERSION 1,2,3,0
BEGIN
 BLOCK "StringFileInfo"
 BEGIN
  BLOCK "040904b0"
  BEGIN
   VALUE "FileVersion", "1.2.3.0"
   VALUE "ProductVersion", "1.2.3.0"
  END
 END
END
```
will be replaced with:
```
VS_VERSION_INFO VERSIONINFO
 FILEVERSION 1, 2, 4, 0
 PRODUCTVERSION 1, 2, 4, 0
BEGIN
 BLOCK "StringFileInfo"
 BEGIN
  BLOCK "040904b0"
  BEGIN
   VALUE "FileVersion", "1, 2, 4, 0"
   VALUE "ProductVersion", "1, 2, 4, 0"
  END
 END
END
```

Run with /? parameter for command line options.

Example command lines, assume your build environment will replace $(SCCREVISION) with a number:
```
  RCVersion C:\Projects\RCVersion\RCVersion\RCVersion.rc /b:$(SCCREVISION)
  RCVersion C:\Projects\RCVersion\RCVersion\RCVersion.rc /b:$(SCCREVISION) /m:1 /n:3 /r:0
```

This program may or may not process invalid RC files.

This program will handle standard RC files as generated by Visual Studio. It will not handle
comments embedded in the middle of the version even if RC.exe would accept that. Such files
are not normally created by Visual Studio. Example:

Accepted by RC.exe and accepted by RCVersion:
```
 /**/FILEVERSION/**/ 1, 2, 3, 4/**/
 /**/VALUE/**/ "FileVersion"/**/,/**/ "1, 2, 3, 4/**/"
```

Accepted by RC.exe but not accepted by RCVersion:
```
 FILEVERSION 1/**/,2, 3, 4
 FILEVERSION 1,/**/2, 3, 4
```
